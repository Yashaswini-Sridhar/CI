Explanation of Workflow:
 * on: Defines when the workflow runs (on push or pull request to main).
 * jobs: Defines the jobs in the workflow.
   * build:
     * runs-on: ubuntu-latest: Runs the job on an Ubuntu virtual machine.
     * steps: Defines the steps in the job.
       * Checkout code: Checks out the code from the repository.
       * Install GCC: Installs the GCC compiler.
       * Build: Runs make to build the program.
       * Run: Executes the compiled program.
   * deploy-staging:
     * needs: build: Ensures the build job completes successfully before running.
     * environment: {name: staging}: defines the environment as staging.
     * Simulate deployment: Simulates a deployment to a staging environment.

5. Steps to Set Up:
 * Commit and Push: Commit and push all the files to your GitHub repository.
 * GitHub Actions: Go to your repository on GitHub and click on the "Actions" tab.
 * Workflow Run: You'll see the workflow running. Click on it to see the progress.
 * Monitoring: Monitor the workflow's progress and check the logs for any errors.
 * Fixing Issues: If the build or run steps fail, check the logs to identify the problem and fix your code or Makefile.
 * Simulated Deployment: Observe the simulated deployment step.
 * Real Deployment (Enhancement): To make this a real deployment, replace the "Simulate deployment" step with actual deployment commands:
   * If deploying to a server, you could use scp to copy the executable.
   * If deploying to a cloud platform, you might use the platform's CLI tools.
Example of an error and fix:
 * Error: If you forgot to install GCC, the build step will fail.
 * Fix: Add the "Install GCC" step to the workflow file.
 * Error: if there is a syntax error in the c code, the make command will fail.
 * Fix: Fix the syntax error in the c code.
This guide provides a basic CI/CD pipeline setup for a C program using GitHub Actions. You can expand it by adding more tests, deployment steps, and other features as needed.
